Data for paper: Xu, W., Lyu, B., Ru, X., Li, D., Gu, W., Ma, X., ... & Gao, J.-H. (2024). Decoding the temporal structures and interactions of multiple face dimensions using optically pumped magnetometer magnetoencephalography (OPM-MEG). *Journal of Neuroscience*, 44(47).

For the configuration and main entrance, please run `python face_0_main.py`. `face_1_prep.py` is for preprocessing. Note that we provide a flag `cfg['auto_flag']` to control whether the preprocessing is done automatically or manually. This flag should be set to `cfg['auto_flag']=True`, to avoid bulky manual work. `face_2_dec.py` is for SVM decoding, including SVM decoding for temporal dynamics, temporal generalization, and SVM decoding in the test-retest section. `face_3_rsa.py` is for representational similarity analysis. `face_4_stat.py` is for some statistical tests. `face_6_bayes.m` is used to run Bayesian model selection. It should be run manually as the main entrance `face_0_main.py` only includes steps `1` to `4`. Before running this MATLAB script, ensure you have installed [VBA toolbox](https://github.com/MBB-team/VBA-toolbox) in your search path.
