For the configuration and main entrance, please run `python face_0_main.py`.

`face_1_prep.py` is for preprocessing. Note that we provide a flag `cfg['auto_flag']` to control whether the preprocessing is done automatically or manually. This flag should be set to `cfg['auto_flag']=True`, to avoid bulky manual work. 

`face_2_dec.py` is for SVM decoding, including SVM decoding for temporal dynamics, temporal generalization, and SVM decoding in the test-retest section. 

`face_3_rsa.py` is for representational similarity analysis. 

`face_4_stat.py` is for some statistical tests. 

`face_6_bayes.m` is used to run Bayesian model selection. It should be run manually as the main entrance `face_0_main.py` only includes steps `1` to `4`. Before running this Matlab script, ensure you have installed [VBA toolbox](https://github.com/MBB-team/VBA-toolbox) in your search path. 

Note that all of the preprocessed data and intermediate results are placed in the `derivatives` folder (of course you could change it to wherever you want simply by referring to the configuration in `face_0_main.py`). 

In the `./code/experiment` folder is the script for the experiment. Before running the experiment, ensure you have set up [Psychtoolbox](https://github.com/Psychtoolbox-3/Psychtoolbox-3) correctly in the Matlab searching path. The usage is detailed in `main.m`. The stimuli are placed in the `./stimuli/meg` folder.
